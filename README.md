# Extractall
This scripts goes through the sub folders of the chosen folder and checks for .rar files, and then extracts the content to a folder called "\_output" which it will make by itself.

# How to use
Unless it's the file "here" in the name:
Use "Run" (shortcut: windows key + R) and write: extractall "filepath". e.g: extractall "c:\user\Thomrl\received files\Cake"

You need to have installed the modules pyunpack and patool.

If it's the new file with "here" in the name:
Simply run the script in the folder containing the folders with rar files in them.
